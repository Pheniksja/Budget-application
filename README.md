A budget calculator to measure monthly expenses and income.

I've created a simple application for calculating monthly expenses.
I used Bootstrap 4.2.

In the future I want to add some function, like calculate in every expenses - what is the amonut of Percentage of Budget.
I want to add saving the amount  in local storage (now if you refresh it's gone).
